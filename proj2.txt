Use asccii
read local values
1 byte can do -128 to 127, so we can use only one for temp (goes to -50 to 40)
we need more for ppi

ex: implement getTemperature() -> reads from device driver but read from vector (emulated)
sendChar("v");
rxChar("v");  #  Get oldest char in buffer


ex: # RT+21H085C00823 999 !
